# Pharmacy Workflow Simulation & Optimization

This project simulates a real-world pharmacy prescription and vaccination system using **Arena Simulation Software** to identify bottlenecks, optimize staffing, and improve patient experience.

📍 **Location Simulated**: Pharmacy on Main Avenue, Norwalk, CT  
📅 **Date Observed**: October 25, 2024  
🧠 **Software**: Arena by Rockwell Automation

---

## Key Findings

- **Drop-Off Process** was the biggest bottleneck with a max wait of **26 minutes**
- **Pharmacist** utilization: **76.7%** (overloaded!)
- **Nurse** utilization: **34.6%** (underutilized)
- **Pick-Up** process was the most efficient (avg. 0.05 in queue)

---

## Recommendations

- Reallocate tasks or add staff during Drop-Off peak times
- Cross-train nurses to assist during idle periods
- Promote the pharmacy’s mobile app to reduce in-store interactions
- Stagger staff breaks instead of shutting down during 1:30–2:00 PM
- Automate non-critical steps to reduce pharmacist load
